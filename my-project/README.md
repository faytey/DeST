## New Features

### Groups Table

The application now includes a comprehensive table view of all available groups:

- `JoinGroup`: Interface to join existing groups
- `EarningsDisplay`: Shows user's earnings from the protocol

## Technical Implementation

The GroupsTable component:

- Uses the `groupCounter` function to determine the total number of groups
- Loads group data in batches using the `readGroupData` utility function
- Implements proper error handling and loading states
- Provides real-time blockchain data reading using viem public client
- Supports joining groups directly from the table interface
